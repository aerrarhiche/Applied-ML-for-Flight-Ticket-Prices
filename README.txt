The Flight Price Prediction dataset contains information about flights between various cities in India, including departure and arrival times, airlines, stops, and prices. The dataset has the following features:
Airline: The name of the airline company.
Source: The city from which the flight departs.
Destination: The city to which the flight arrives.
Departure Time: The scheduled departure time of the flight.
Arrival Time: The scheduled arrival time of the flight.
Duration: The total duration of the flight (in minutes).
Total Stops: The number of stops between the source and destination.
Additional Info: Additional information about the flight.
Price: The price of the ticket (in Indian Rupees).

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of airline tickets based on historical data.

Approach: To achieve this objective, we will follow these steps:
  1. Data exploration and preparation: We will begin by exploring the Flight Price Prediction dataset to understand the characteristics of the data, identify any missing or incomplete data, and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  2. Feature engineering: We will create new features from the existing data that can provide additional information and improve the predictive power of our model. For example, we could create features such as the day of the week, the month, or the time of day for each flight.
  3. Model selection: We will select a suitable machine learning algorithm that can effectively learn from the data and make accurate predictions. Possible algorithms could include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
  4. Model training and evaluation: We will split the dataset into training and test sets, and use the training set to train the chosen machine learning model. We will then evaluate the performance of the model on the test set, using metrics such as mean squared error or R-squared.
  5. Hyperparameter tuning and model refinement: We will fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen machine learning algorithm and experiment with different combinations of features and preprocessing techniques to improve the performance of our model.
  6. Deployment and usage: Once we have developed a model that meets our desired performance metrics, we will deploy it in a real-world setting where it can be used to make predictions about the prices of airline tickets for future flights.
